# Power-Bi-India-Transformation-2001-to-2011
The transformation in India from 2001 to 2011 indicates changes in poverty rate, unemployment rate, population growth, literacy rate, and per capita income, reflecting shifts in socio-economic conditions over the decade.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The dataset required for the dashboard preparation is sourced from <a href= 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/indian-statewise-data-from-rbi'>Kaggle</a>. The purpose of the dashboard is to evaluate the performance of India and its states from 2001 to 2011 based on various parameters, including unemployment rate, poverty rate, literacy rate, and per capita income.
</br>
The Dashbord is inclusion of matrix, slicers, graphs, and KPI's.
<h2>Overview:</h2>
</br>
<b>The names of matrixes present in the dashboards are:</b>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>States Below Average Literacy Rate</li>
  <li>States Above unemployment Rate</li>
  <li>States Below Average Povert Rate</li>
</ul>
These matrix visualizations will show the top 5 poor-performing states.
</br>
</br>
<b>The names of KPI's present in the dashboard are:</b>
</br>
<ul>
These matrix visualizations will show the top 5 poor-performing states.
</br>
</br>
<b>The names of KPI's present in the dashboard are:</b>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Percentage Change (2001-2011) for Literacy Rate, Poverty Rate, and Unemployment Rate (as per the slicer selection)</li>
  <li>Year 2001 Population</li>
  <li>Year 2011 Population</li>
</ul>
</br>
<b>The names of graphs present in the dashboard are:</b>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Relationship Between Literacy and Unemployment Rate</li>
  <li>Percentage Change in Poverty and Income from 2001 to 2011</li>
</ul>
</br>
<b>The slicers present in the dashboard are:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Year (results in changes in matrix visualizations)</li>
  <li>Select the View (results in changes in KPIs)</li>
</ul>
</br>

<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<b> Matrix visualization Analysis: </b>
</br>
<ul>
<li>If <b>All</b> is selected in the Year slicer, the average literacy, poverty, and unemployment rates for India in 2001 and 2011 are displayed.</li>
<li>India showed improvement by decreasing the poverty rate and increasing the literacy rate from 2001 to 2011. However, the unemployment rate increased by approximately 8% during this decade, which was not a positive indicator for a developing India.</li>
  
</ul>
</br>
<b>Graph Analysis:</b>
</br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Relationship Between Literacy and Unemployment Rate:</b></li>
  <p>The literacy rate across all states increased from 2001 to 2011. However, concerning trends were observed in the unemployment rates for Nagaland and Tripura, which saw a drastic increase in 2011 compared to 2001.</p>
  <li><b>Percentage Change in Poverty and Income (2001-2011):</b></li>
  <p>The poverty percentage increased significantly in Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, and Manipur, indicating that these states became poorer in 2011 compared to 2001. Conversely, states like Andaman and Nicobar, Sikkim, and Meghalaya showed the best performance by decreasing their poverty rates.
</br>
Despite the changes in poverty rates, the per capita income for all states increased. Notably, Sikkim experienced a commendable increase in per capita income, exceeding 500% in 2011 compared to 2001.
</p>
</ul>

</br>
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<b> Matrix visualization Analysis: </b>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>If <b>2001</b> is selected in the Year slicer, The matrix shows the top 5 worst performing states on parameters of Povery rate, Unemployment Rate, and Literacy Rate. Performance average of these states are below the overall performance of India. If I will select Slicer as 2011 I will get corresponding change in matrix visualization.  </li>
</ul>
</br>
<b> KPI Analysis: </b>
</br>
<ul>
 <li><b>Literacy Rate:<b> When selecting the Literacy Rate view in the Select View slicer, the KPI indicates a 12.08% increase in India's literacy rate in 2011 as compared to 2001.</li>
 <li><b>Poverty Rate:<b> Changing the slicer view to Poverty Rate shows a 17.84% decrease in India's poverty rate, indicating a significant reduction in overall poverty in 2011 as compared to 2001.</li>
 <li><b>Unemployment Rate:<b> In the Unemployment Rate view, the KPI reveals a 37.66% increase in the unemployment rate for India in 2011 as compared to 2001.</li>
 <li><b>Population:<b> The Population KPI shows that India's population increased by 20 billion from 2001 to 2011.</li>
</ul>
